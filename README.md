# Shopping list

Earlier program written in pyton 2.7. Takes a general shopping database in xml format (because excell exported easily to xml format and I was blisfully unaware that csv files are 1000x easier to work with) and extracts which items need to be bought again, based on time last put on a list and how long they can last. Output is "shoppinglist.txt", which shows which items have to be bought, what the expted price is per item and the expected total cost of an item.
